# Barbenheimer VS Code Theme

This VS Code theme draws inspiration from the cultural phenomenon "Barbenheimer," which arose from the coinciding release dates of Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. It playfully blends the vibrant and colorful world of Barbie with the stark and intense imagery of Oppenheimer, resulting in a unique coding experience.

The theme offers three distinct variants, each capturing a different facet of the Barbenheimer concept. Whether you prefer the bright cheerfulness of Barbie's world or the somber atmosphere of Oppenheimer's, there's a style to fit your coding mood and personalize your VS Code environment.
