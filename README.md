# Barbenheimer

Barbenheimer is a VS Code theme inspired by the Internet phenomenon of the same name. It combines the pink and playful aesthetics of Barbie with the dark and dramatic tones of Oppenheimer, creating a unique and fun contrast for your coding environment.

The theme is based on [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)'s [Night Owl theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl), which is a beautiful and accessible theme with great color contrast and a dark background. Barbenheimer modifies some of the colors and fonts to match the mood and style of the two films.

Whether you're working on a fantasy comedy or an epic biographical drama, Barbenheimer will make your code look awesome. Try it today and join the Barbenheimer craze!
